# CYBR GEO / Mechanism Lab

Procedural geometry, named CAD/mesh assemblies, internal and exploded inspection, geometry-rendered video, individual-part catalogues, and whiteprint engineering drawings.

**Both source toolkits are published here:** the newer `lab` CLI (`src/mechanism_lab`) and the original `cybrgeo` CLI (`src/cybrgeo`). Model recipes supply geometry, materials, named parts, camera views and motion transforms. The shared infrastructure handles export, rendering, animation, catalogues and drawings; a new part does not need a new renderer.

## ROAM workshop and mobile workstation studies

[ROAM examples](examples/roam) include seven original bench mechanisms, the articulated shared-spine mobile workstation, portable checked-build commands, and a [manufacturing coverage map](examples/roam/MANUFACTURING.md). These are nominal CAD studies with explicit physical and manufacturing limitations; the workshop does not yet manufacture the complete workstation.

## Differential previews

![Exploded differential rendered from geometry](media/differential_exploded.jpg)

![Original drive-study preview](media/drive_preview.gif)

These compact previews were retained from the earlier delivery. Source for the original concept, principal-reference reconstruction and internal/exploded motion study is under [concept v1](archive/concept_v1), [reference v2](archive/reference_v2), and [inspection v3](examples/differential).

The 81-part reference reconstruction and 44-part alternative kinematic core are separate designs. The original interior did not form a connected pinion train; the alternative demonstrates prescribed differential constraints. Neither is a validated torque-bias/contact-force simulation or manufacturing release.

## Two separate motor studies

**REV NEO Vortex + SPARK Flex:** manufacturer mechanical CAD import and an adapted 20T/80T, 4:1 carrier drive. The CAD does not disclose detailed copper windings, magnets or circuitry. See [REV study source](tools/build_motor_study.py), [reference downloader](tools/fetch_references.py), [pinned reference hashes](references/neo_vortex/pinned_sources.json), and [study notes](examples/neo_vortex/README.md).

**M8325s + 2.25:1 belt drive:** procedural motor recipe, illustrative copper coils and magnet poles, and a 32T/72T carrier-drive integration study. Hidden electromagnetic topology is assumed, not recovered factory CAD. See [motor recipe](src/mechanism_lab/models/motor.py), [drive recipe](src/mechanism_lab/models/drivetrain.py), [source/assumption ledger](docs/MOTOR_SOURCES.md), and [compatibility limits](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md).

Both models remain available; one does not silently replace the other. Motor/differential compatibility is a custom-adapter concept, not a validated physical pairing.

## Nitinol fiber actuator

The built-in `nitinol_fiber_actuator` recipe is a 12-fiber straight-wire SMA linear actuator with a guided output carriage, central return spring, fixed/moving crimp carriers, folded series/parallel copper routing, output rod and independent travel stops. The default source-guided configuration uses 0.20 mm actuator wire, 140 mm active length and 3.5% modeled strain for a 4.90 mm nominal stroke.

The 12 fibers are mechanically parallel but electrically arranged as three parallel strings of four fibers in series. The series path alternates between fixed- and moving-end jumpers, returning both main power terminals to the stationary rear plate. Published Dynalloy 0.20 mm wire data anchors the default resistance/current/force/cooling estimates; the frame, spring, crimps, guides and electrical routing are original conceptual geometry rather than vendor CAD.

See [actuator recipe](src/mechanism_lab/models/nitinol_actuator.py) and [design/source notes](docs/NITINOL_ACTUATOR.md). The included numbers are design guides, not thermal, fatigue, structural or load qualification.

## ORBIT inspection wrist showcase

![CYBR ORBIT photographic render](media/orbit_v3_hero.jpg)

A 148-component geared inspection wrist with an opposed-screw parallel
gripper, a hollow lofted palm, integral finger carriages, bearing raceways,
keyed shaft, service conduit and removable housing. The model exercises the
shared geometry, STEP/GLB export, kinematic animation, whiteprint and native
photographic rendering pipelines.

[Serviceable revision 3 and reproduction](docs/ORBIT_SERVICE.md) ·
[Geometry capability coverage](docs/ORBIT_SHOWCASE.md) ·
[Recipe](examples/orbit_inspection_wrist.py) ·
[Build, validation and media tool](tools/orbit_service.py)

Revision 3 uses analytic CAD for every component, including the spline conduit.
Its 331-operation service procedure releases fasteners in order, keeps purchased
bearings and bonded units intact, and withdraws shafts, guides and threaded nuts
along explicit paths. The assembly animation follows those paths in reverse.
The validation reports distinguish sampled nominal CAD clearance from physical
prototype, manufacturing-tolerance and load qualification.

## Shared photographic rendering in 0.5

`lab render`, `lab video`, `lab film`, `cybrgeo render`, and `cybrgeo video`
use the same native photographic implementation by default. Both Python APIs
share the material model, thin-lens camera, fixed studio, color transfer and
geometry-guided image finishing. New CAD parts use analytic surface normals
by default. Use `--renderer pbr` with `lab`, or `--backend pbr` with `cybrgeo`,
for the explicitly selected fast preview.

See [shared defaults, installation and compatibility](docs/SHARED_PHOTOGRAPHY.md).

The accompanying toolkit fixes repair high-tooth-count involute root
self-intersections and drawing dimensions for models above the origin.
Selected geometry/interface checks are recorded separately from unqualified
load and manufacturing claims.

## CYBR YARD / DIY skatepark

A 22 × 16 m parametric skatepark with a layered timber mini ramp, bank, quarter pipe, low street obstacles, coping, framing and access stairs. The 1,404-part design uses the normal CYBR GEO assembly/export pipeline and the V9 native photographic renderer with explicitly selected outdoor lighting. Its added finishes do not change existing product-studio defaults.

[Design, dimensions, reproduction and limitations](examples/diy_skatepark/README.md) · [Parametric recipe](examples/diy_skatepark/recipe.py) · [Geometry tests](tests/test_diy_skatepark.py)

This is a geometry/rendering study, not construction-qualified plans or a rider/structural simulation. The offline native renders and the optional self-contained WebGL geometry inspector are distinct outputs.

## Install

Python 3.11–3.13; Linux/WSL is the documented environment. Install FFmpeg, a C++17/OpenMP compiler, CMake, Cairo, EGL/OpenGL and Mesa system libraries first. The wheel contains the native photographic source and can render independent recipes without a repository checkout. Historical built-in recipes still need their documented reference assets.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cybrdelic/cybr-geo.git
cd cybr-geo
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements-tested.txt
python -m pip install --no-deps -e .
lab doctor
```

## Reuse for a new part

For the manufacturer-CAD motor:

```bash
python tools/fetch_references.py
python tools/import_motor.py
python -c 'from tools.build_motor_study import prepare_motor; prepare_motor()'
python tools/render_motor_study.py --motor-only
```

`tools/build_release_media.py` reproduces the later motor and belt-drive media after the differential inputs are available. It includes the actual camera/animation recipes, not image-generation prompts.

## Whiteprints

Analytic CAD uses OpenCascade hidden-line removal. The drawing tools emit SVG, vector PDF, DXF, PNG and drawing metadata with nominal dimensions, centerlines, explicit units and title blocks. The `lab` mesh-only fallback is explicitly labeled as a projection without hidden-line suppression; `cybrgeo` requires analytic CAD. These are concept/reference drawings, not tolerance-qualified manufacturing drawings.

## Publication and verification

The source import is checksum-verified and unpacked into ordinary tracked files. The README previews are ordinary image/GIF files, not Git LFS pointers. [Server-side source receipts](docs/publication_receipts) record the transferred archive checksums.

**Source publication is distinct from binary-archive publication.** The full historical MP4s, per-part renders, STEP/GLB outputs and original NPZ input archives are not all in this checkout. The retained source can regenerate them; the reconstruction script does not falsely label regenerated arrays as byte-identical originals. Original delivery descriptions in the documentation describe their historical local packages, not a guarantee that every binary is in the GitHub tree. [Publication inventory](docs/PUBLICATION_INVENTORY.md) lists this distinction.

Run the source-only smoke tests without requiring the original output archives:

```bash
python -m pytest -q tests/test_core.py tests/test_drawings_media.py tests/test_nitinol_actuator.py tests_legacy -k "not individual_motor_parts"
# Full suite, after building inputs and the optional release artifacts:
python -m pytest -q
```

The tests cover analytic geometry, cache integrity, units, import/export, transforms, decoded GLB animations, belt-path continuity, vectors in drawings, actual changing video frames, the Nitinol actuator's electrical/kinematic invariants, and README asset paths. A test definition or historical report is not itself proof of a fresh successful run.

The repository's GPL-2.0 license is retained for project code. Manufacturer CAD, photographs, drawings and trademarks retain their own rights. No mechanical, electromagnetic, thermal or load qualification is claimed.
